Back in 1996 I remember seeing a promo video (commercial) on <a href="https://youtu.be/fEs8LanCuKw?list=RDSCf4203RnLM">The Box</a>, a now defunct music video channel, for a group called Crucial Conflict. To paraphrase the tagline, "The sun rises in the east and sets in the west but its highest point is in the middle." Those words were voiced over video footage of a horse-drawn carriage riding through the hood. Soon, I saw the video for "Hay" with the country-western-inspired imagery of barnyards, cowboys, leather and denim overalls offset by the urban imagery of Black men with braided hair rapping about "smoking on hay in the middle of the barn." The description may seem ridiculous, especially by today's standards of what good rap music is, but they pulled it off well.

Crucial Conflict emerged from Chicago at a time when the R&B infused raps about street life were winding down and the violent, gang-related lyrics of drill music had yet to come. They had a good mix of solid lyricism and unique style with their "rodeo rap." Instead of following the quick-tongue style that was popularized in their region they were similar to Three Six Mafia in delivery and Lil' Jon's crunk music for the party factor. I remember their debut album "The Final Tic" selling Gold at some point and when I started high school later that year "Hay" was playing in portable stereos once class let out for the day.

They had fallen off of my radar for a couple of years until I saw a video for "Scummy," the lead single from a follow-up album titled "Good Side Bad Side". True to their original form they were back with the hard-hitting rodeo rap that made you subconsciously nod your head. I heard them featured on a song with R. Kelly but aside from that they never made it big, which is sad because I consider them to be the most innovative rap outfit from Chicago in the 90's. I recently revisited their music on Spotify and was enthused to see a Crucial Conflict release from this year only to find out that it was a heavy metal group using the name. Maybe the group has long since called it quits but for at least a brief period of time they made their mark on rap music.
