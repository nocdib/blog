In about seven weeks I will be turning 35 so on that following day I will be closer to age 40 than I will be to age 30. I have always embraced being young but age 35 marks the official end of all things youthful. That is just my personal perspective and since I've procrastinated with the nebulous task of "getting my act together" since I was 18 I feel a certain sense of urgency in doing it now.

Nothing that I do in the next two months will radically change my status in life (or will it?) but I do have some realistic goals that I would like to reach in that time:

<b>1) Finish hacking together my work side-project</b><br/>
While I can't go into detail about the particulars of this project I can say that it is very doable and that, if nothing else, it would provide me with experience in immersing myself with new technology and devising a final product in relative short order. This project will push my personal project, YB, to a secondary priority but that experience will be applicable.

<b>2) Get stronger and more flexible</b><br/>
For the past two weeks I've been doing isolated yoga stretches to increase flexibility in my hips, shoulders and back. I'd like to be more consistent with that, preferably five days a week, and at the same time I would like to start increasing my basic strength with bodyweight exercises like push-ups, abdominal crunches and air squats. I don't have a specific benchmark set but if I see myself being more flexible and able to increase my exercise repetitions then mission accomplished.

<b>3) Update this blog</b><br/>
This blog can use a theme update so I should take a couple of hours and give it a facelift.

<b>4) Finish reading at least two books</b><br/>
It isn't a tall order to finish reading two books in seven weeks but with everything that I do during the day I limit my reading time to only during my work commute. A total of 90 minutes each day is 7.5 hours in a work week. That should be more than enough to finish two books.

Now that I have my goals specified and a deadline established I should really get and do what needs to be done or deal with the embarrassment of making birthday blog post admitting my shortcomings. So, time to get started.
