If you ask a group of true hip-hop fans who the top 5 greatest lyricists of all time are you'd likely hear the name Rakim mentioned at least 70% of the time. Your favorite rapper (over the age of 30) probably has him in the top 3. His whole persona embodied the essence of what I remembered 80's New York City hip-hop being but I didn't catch onto him until his first solo album was released in 1997. Prior to that he was part of the eponymous DJ/MC duo Eric B and Rakim but their career spanned from 1987 to 1992, or from when I was between ages 5 and 10. As a kid, the only people around my age who knew of their music learned of them through an older sibling so I didn't acknowledge them until I had gotten much older.<br/>
<br/>
I can't recall when exactly was the first time I had heard "I Ain't No Joke" but I know it was the bass drum and clap pattern that caught me first and then Rakim's braggadocious lyrics. The music video also captured the zeitgeist of NYC at the time with the flat-top haircuts, Fila windbreakers, gold rope chains, rings on all fingers, graffiti murals, etc. If I had to pick one definitive track for hip-hop in the late 80's it would be this one for it's versatility as a party-rocker, a lyrical showcase and a DJ showcase. It's crazy how it's almost 30 years old.<br/>
