It's time to start over, but not from scratch.

In 2009 I wrote <a href="https://nocdib.wordpress.com/2009/08/12/in-the-beginning/">a blog post</a> as a test for using WordPress but I had also hoped that it would get the ball rolling for me to pursue a personal mobile development project which would provide me with material to start regularly blogging about. In short, it never happened. Years later, <a href="http://blog.nocdib.com/Setting-up-a-Squid-proxy-using-Digital-Ocean/">I tried again</a> but still failed to be consistent with tech blogging. Last year, <a href="http://blog.nocdib.com/A-journey-of-a-thousand-miles-begins-with-a-leap/">I started blogging for a third time</a> but, while I did manage to post more frequently than the previous two times, I failed to be as consistent as I had wanted to be and I was still light on the technical posts. So, today, I have decided to change my approach.

I named this blog "Bits, Rhymes, and Life" because I wanted to chronicle elements of my life in addition to topics on programming. In the last year I've done and experienced quite a few things that are worth posting about but, for some reason, I didn't. In the process of reading Jordan Mechner's "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Making-Prince-Persia-Jordan-Mechner-ebook/dp/B005WUE6Q2">The Making of Prince of Persia: Journals 1985 - 1993</a>" which chronicles his creation of the classic computer game <i>Prince of Persia</i> I noticed that although his entries were sometimes weeks, even months, apart he wasn't afraid to write about even his uneventful days. Years later, his journal portrays him as being a person who wrote computer software rather than just a computer programmer. That's the same effect I would like to achieve with blogging--having a tangible journal that recounts both my technical achievements and personal experiences that are worth remembering.

To make this blog align with my newfound goal I've decided to reconstruct it in two phases. The first step is to make at least 30 posts in the next three months. At a target rate of one post every three days I should be able to make mostly non-trivial posts regularly. If I am making trivial posts regularly then that's a sign that I should be more productive with my time. Hopefully, this will become a habit that I will do without needing to set explicit benchmarks. In addition to that I want to include more images into my posts. The second step is to redesign my entire site, including the blog. The redesign is a goal I had since late last year but a combination of lethargy and indecisiveness kept it from happening. I'm close to deciding on a theme, layout, etc. and it will most likely be built with <a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a>, a departure from the current <a href="http://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> platform. In the interim I will continue to blog in Hugo but in three months time I hope to have everything settled under WordPress with all previous posts migrated.

So, starting from today, this blog will look more like a personal journal rather than a blog. Maybe it won't look like what I have in mind, initially, but if I keep at it things will take shape.
