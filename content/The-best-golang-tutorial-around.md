<i>TL;DR: Read <a href="http://www.golangbootcamp.com/book" target="_new">this tutorial</a> and watch <a href="https://www.udemy.com/learn-how-to-code/learn/v4/content" target="_new">these videos</a>.</i>

Golang, also known as Go, has been gaining traction in recent years as a mainstream programming language, particularly in the space of web services. At a time when dynamically-typed, interpreted languages like Python and Ruby are dominating that arena while the frameworks that are built with them are handling front-end content or REST API calls I found it interesting that a statically-typed, compiled language had a growing buzz around it. Back in Spring 2012, after I had just ended a job that made heavy use of Erlang I remember my cousin's husband mentioning his interest in learning Go. Having just dealt with a niche language like Erlang--which I found to be unpleasant--I wasn't interested in even hearing about another programming language that hadn't been widely adopted.

In the middle of 2014 <a href="http://nickmanning.net/" target="_new">Nick Manning</a> started the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/nycgolang/" target="_new">Golang NYC meetup group</a> and I began attending since I already knew him from the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/nycneo4j/" target="_new">NYC Neo4j meetup group</a>. Hearing the testimonials of Go converts piqued my interest but one meeting in particular made me want to try the language for myself. <a href="http://www.bjornroche.com/" target="_new">Bjorn Roche</a> gave a presentation about using the <a href="https://revel.github.io/" target="_new">Revel web framework</a> to power the backend of the mobile app <a href="https://www.shimmeo.com/" target="_new">Shimmeo</a>. During the presentation he compared Revel to the Java/Scala web framework <a href="http://www.playframework.com" target="_new">Play</a>. I had a strong interest in Play and was about to use it on my own personal project but after hearing that there was a Go equivalent I was convinced to give Go and Revel a try. Nothing helps you learn a new language better than actually implementing something with it.

My first step was to learn Go. I'm pretty particular with my learning materials and I'm just not the type who becomes proficient from online documentation and web searches alone. Finding the right introductory material wasn't easy since there was a dearth of tutorials and well-written, published books on Go. I had found one e-book, whose name I will not mention, but I found its explanation and the progression of material to be deficient. By chance I had stumbled upon one of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/toddmcleod" target="_new">Todd Mcleod's</a> YouTube videos and left a comment. He quickly responded and suggested that I take a look at a new Golang video course that he recently published on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/learn-how-to-code/learn/v4/content" target="_new">Udemy</a>. I bought access to the videos for a nominal fee and it was the best investment in programming-related material that I have ever made. Simply put, if you have prior computer programming experience there is no way that you couldn't become proficient with Go by the end of the course. While doing the course I had also come across Matt Aimonetti's e-book <a href="http://www.golangbootcamp.com/book" target="_new">Go Bootcamp</a> and noticed that Todd McLeod's course actually elaborated on many of those examples.

If you are interested in learning Go and are looking for a tutorial that blends brevity with comprehensiveness then I suggest reading <a href="http://www.golangbootcamp.com/book" target="_new">Go Bootcamp</a>. If you need greater depth then look at <a href="https://www.udemy.com/learn-how-to-code/learn/v4/content" target="_new">Todd's video course on Udemy</a>. After tackling the language with these resources I actually found it better to create my own REST API without using a framework. Go is a powerful language that allows you to do just that without a lot of overhead.
