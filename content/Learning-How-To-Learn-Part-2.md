My <a href="../Learning-How-To-Learn-Part-1/">first post</a> on learning how to learn was inspired from watching this video:<br/>

Josh Kaufman’s words struck a cord with me because he eloquently and concisely summed up in 23 minutes what it took me years to learn. Some of the concepts are still a work-in-progress for me today. Interestingly enough, he mentions that learning computer programming was part of his research into the basic effort necessary to become proficient at something. Becoming a better, more marketable programmer is what continues to motivate me in refining my ability to learn and retain new information while efficiently managing my time. When he distilled the principles into five steps it all made sense relative to my personal experiences.

<ol>
<li><b>Be specific with your goals</b><br/>
The more general your goals are, the more likely you are to lose focus. Success is a journey, the progressive realization of a goal, and every journey is a culmination of a series of steps. When you outline the steps that you will take instead of just focusing on the desired destination you will more efficiently reach your destination without deviating off course.

To be a good basketball player you have to at least be able to move effectively with the ball and pass it. Depending on the position you play your ball-handling ability needs to be better than other's. In addition to that you may need to be more skilled as a long-range or mid-range shooter than someone who is taller and better built to being near the basket. Similarly, the person near the basket needs to be stronger and more powerful to be an imposing force against defenders in tight spaces. Then you have the defensive aspects that each player needs to focus on as well. When you consider all of these things it becomes evident that simply having the goal of becoming a good basketball player can lead you to go around in circles doing basketball-related activities without focusing on what specifically would make you a good player.
</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Identify the aggregate components that your goals are comprised of</b><br/>
Along the lines of a goal being a series of steps most general skills are a combination of other related skills. With the basketball analogy there are various skills at work to make a good player and each requires its own level of attention. Handling the ball requires practice as does shooting the ball. Sometimes there is overlap and sometimes the skills are isolated but they each require attention. Once you identify these accompanying components you are better able to strategize your approach to the goal step-by-step.
</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Select the resources that will help you to learn what is necessary to accomplish your goals</b><br/>
My first post on this subject focused on this point. Choosing resources is crucial. Garbage input leads to garbage output so evaluate proven material, see which works best with your style of learning and build your knowledge base.
</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Create an environment conducive to practicing</b><br/>
Some people can feel productive working in a bustling coffee shop. Some people prefer studying in the shared quiet space of a library. Other people need personal isolation whether it’s quiet or not. Establish whichever environmental configuration works for you, eliminate distractions and get to work.
</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Allocate 20 consistent hours to dedicate towards practice</b><br/>
If you want to do something well you have to be able to at least dedicate 20 hours to it. Anything less would be a trivial attempt. If you can’t carve out that much time from your schedule to do something then you aren’t in a position to be able to do it well. Consistent hours doesn’t necessarily mean continuous hours so for some things 20 minutes a day may be sufficient whereas two hours a day in the form of two one-hour sessions is needed for others. In either case, daily practice at these levels will result in measurable improvement from when you started. If you practice something for two hours one day a week you most likely be stuck on a metaphorical hamster wheel because your lapses far exceed your efforts. Consistency is the key and the more often you do something the quicker it becomes second nature. The more time you put into doing something, the better the result will be.
</li>
