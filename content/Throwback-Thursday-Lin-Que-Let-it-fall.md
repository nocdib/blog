Thanks to YouTube's autoplay feature this mid-90's gem started playing. In a day where Nicki Minaj is the queen of NYC rap it's nice to take a trip down memory lane to 21 years ago when female emcees were as gritty as the guys. Lin Que was cut from the same cloth as Champ MC, Boss, Nonchalant and Fugees-era Lauryn Hill.

Interestingly enough, Hype Williams co-directed the video and he is the father of the 90's Hip Hop music video directors. This video shows his signature use of fades between shots but while he's known for his use of vivid color he went for black-an-white this time. Under Sylvia Rhone's guidance Elektra Records was responsible for a number of female acts in 90's urban music. Lin Que wasn't as commercially successful as labelmates like Missy Elliot but she defnitely represented lyrically.
