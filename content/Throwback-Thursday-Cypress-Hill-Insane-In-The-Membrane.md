In observance of Cinco de Mayo (Mexican Independence Day) I'll walk down memory lane with the Cypress Hill. Truth be told B-Real is half-Mexican, Sen Dog is Cuban and DJ Muggs is Italian-American but still. The "Black Sunday" album was one of the first cassette tapes I had ever bought. "Insane in the Membrane" was the lead single which ended up becoming a hit nationwide. I'd say it is still one of the defining Hip-Hop tracks of the 90's among the likes of "Baby Got Back" by Sir-Mix-A-Lot and "Jump Around" by House of Pain. "I Ain't Going Out Like That" was a hard-hitting follow-up track along the lines of "Deep Cover." With two strong lead singles Black Sunday definitely made Cypress Hill known on the East Coast but their several subsequent albums never had the same appeal or radio attention. Honestly, I can't say that I have heard Cypress Hill on East Coast radio since Black Sunday. The tracks that I like which came afterwards are ones that I saw music videos for: "Tequila Sunrise" and "Rap Superstar." Maybe in this era of streaming music I should take the time to catch up on their discography. I'll put that on my to-do list for next week.
