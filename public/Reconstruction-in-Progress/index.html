			 	<h1>Reconstruction in Progress</h1>
			  <span class="post-date">Thu, Apr 20, 2017</span>
			      <p>It&rsquo;s time to start over, but not from scratch.</p>

<p>In 2009 I wrote <a href="https://nocdib.wordpress.com/2009/08/12/in-the-beginning/">a blog post</a> as a test for using WordPress but I had also hoped that it would get the ball rolling for me to pursue a personal mobile development project which would provide me with material to start regularly blogging about. In short, it never happened. Years later, <a href="http://blog.nocdib.com/Setting-up-a-Squid-proxy-using-Digital-Ocean/">I tried again</a> but still failed to be consistent with tech blogging. Last year, <a href="http://blog.nocdib.com/A-journey-of-a-thousand-miles-begins-with-a-leap/">I started blogging for a third time</a> but, while I did manage to post more frequently than the previous two times, I failed to be as consistent as I had wanted to be and I was still light on the technical posts. So, today, I have decided to change my approach.</p>

<p>I named this blog &ldquo;Bits, Rhymes, and Life&rdquo; because I wanted to chronicle elements of my life in addition to topics on programming. In the last year I&rsquo;ve done and experienced quite a few things that are worth posting about but, for some reason, I didn&rsquo;t. In the process of reading Jordan Mechner&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Making-Prince-Persia-Jordan-Mechner-ebook/dp/B005WUE6Q2">The Making of Prince of Persia: Journals 1985 - 1993</a>&rdquo; which chronicles his creation of the classic computer game <i>Prince of Persia</i> I noticed that although his entries were sometimes weeks, even months, apart he wasn&rsquo;t afraid to write about even his uneventful days. Years later, his journal portrays him as being a person who wrote computer software rather than just a computer programmer. That&rsquo;s the same effect I would like to achieve with blogging&ndash;having a tangible journal that recounts both my technical achievements and personal experiences that are worth remembering.</p>

<p>To make this blog align with my newfound goal I&rsquo;ve decided to reconstruct it in two phases. The first step is to make at least 30 posts in the next three months. At a target rate of one post every three days I should be able to make mostly non-trivial posts regularly. If I am making trivial posts regularly then that&rsquo;s a sign that I should be more productive with my time. Hopefully, this will become a habit that I will do without needing to set explicit benchmarks. In addition to that I want to include more images into my posts. The second step is to redesign my entire site, including the blog. The redesign is a goal I had since late last year but a combination of lethargy and indecisiveness kept it from happening. I&rsquo;m close to deciding on a theme, layout, etc. and it will most likely be built with <a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a>, a departure from the current <a href="http://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> platform. In the interim I will continue to blog in Hugo but in three months time I hope to have everything settled under WordPress with all previous posts migrated.</p>

<p>So, starting from today, this blog will look more like a personal journal rather than a blog. Maybe it won&rsquo;t look like what I have in mind, initially, but if I keep at it things will take shape.</p>
