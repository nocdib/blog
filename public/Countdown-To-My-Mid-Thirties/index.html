			 	<h1>Countdown To My Mid-Thirties</h1>
			  <span class="post-date">Tue, Nov 22, 2016</span>
			      <p>In about seven weeks I will be turning 35 so on that following day I will be closer to age 40 than I will be to age 30. I have always embraced being young but age 35 marks the official end of all things youthful. That is just my personal perspective and since I&rsquo;ve procrastinated with the nebulous task of &ldquo;getting my act together&rdquo; since I was 18 I feel a certain sense of urgency in doing it now.</p>

<p>Nothing that I do in the next two months will radically change my status in life (or will it?) but I do have some realistic goals that I would like to reach in that time:</p>

<p><b>1) Finish hacking together my work side-project</b><br/>
While I can&rsquo;t go into detail about the particulars of this project I can say that it is very doable and that, if nothing else, it would provide me with experience in immersing myself with new technology and devising a final product in relative short order. This project will push my personal project, YB, to a secondary priority but that experience will be applicable.</p>

<p><b>2) Get stronger and more flexible</b><br/>
For the past two weeks I&rsquo;ve been doing isolated yoga stretches to increase flexibility in my hips, shoulders and back. I&rsquo;d like to be more consistent with that, preferably five days a week, and at the same time I would like to start increasing my basic strength with bodyweight exercises like push-ups, abdominal crunches and air squats. I don&rsquo;t have a specific benchmark set but if I see myself being more flexible and able to increase my exercise repetitions then mission accomplished.</p>

<p><b>3) Update this blog</b><br/>
This blog can use a theme update so I should take a couple of hours and give it a facelift.</p>

<p><b>4) Finish reading at least two books</b><br/>
It isn&rsquo;t a tall order to finish reading two books in seven weeks but with everything that I do during the day I limit my reading time to only during my work commute. A total of 90 minutes each day is 7.5 hours in a work week. That should be more than enough to finish two books.</p>

<p>Now that I have my goals specified and a deadline established I should really get and do what needs to be done or deal with the embarrassment of making birthday blog post admitting my shortcomings. So, time to get started.</p>
