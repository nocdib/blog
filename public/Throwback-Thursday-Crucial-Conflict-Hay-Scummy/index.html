Back in 1996 I remember seeing a promo video (commercial) on <a href="https://youtu.be/fEs8LanCuKw?list=RDSCf4203RnLM">The Box</a>, a now defunct music video channel, for a group called Crucial Conflict. To paraphrase the tagline, &ldquo;The sun rises in the east and sets in the west but its highest point is in the middle.&rdquo; Those words were voiced over video footage of a horse-drawn carriage riding through the hood. Soon, I saw the video for &ldquo;Hay&rdquo; with the country-western-inspired imagery of barnyards, cowboys, leather and denim overalls offset by the urban imagery of Black men with braided hair rapping about &ldquo;smoking on hay in the middle of the barn.&rdquo; The description may seem ridiculous, especially by today&rsquo;s standards of what good rap music is, but they pulled it off well.
<br/><br/>
Crucial Conflict emerged from Chicago at a time when the R&amp;B infused raps about street life were winding down and the violent, gang-related lyrics of drill music had yet to come. They had a good mix of solid lyricism and unique style with their &ldquo;rodeo rap.&rdquo; Instead of following the quick-tongue style that was popularized in their region they were similar to Three Six Mafia in delivery and Lil&rsquo; Jon&rsquo;s crunk music for the party factor. I remember their debut album &ldquo;The Final Tic&rdquo; selling Gold at some point and when I started high school later that year &ldquo;Hay&rdquo; was playing in portable stereos once class let out for the day.
<br/><br/>
They had fallen off of my radar for a couple of years until I saw a video for &ldquo;Scummy,&rdquo; the lead single from a follow-up album titled &ldquo;Good Side Bad Side&rdquo;. True to their original form they were back with the hard-hitting rodeo rap that made you subconsciously nod your head. I heard them featured on a song with R. Kelly but aside from that they never made it big, which is sad because I consider them to be the most innovative rap outfit from Chicago in the 90&rsquo;s. I recently revisited their music on Spotify and was enthused to see a Crucial Conflict release from this year only to find out that it was a heavy metal group using the name. Maybe the group has long since called it quits but for at least a brief period of time they made their mark on rap music.</p>
