&lt;br/&gt;
In observance of Cinco de Mayo (Mexican Independence Day) I&amp;rsquo;ll walk down memory lane with the Cypress Hill. Truth be told B-Real is half-Mexican, Sen Dog is Cuban and DJ Muggs is Italian-American but still. The &amp;ldquo;Black Sunday&amp;rdquo; album was one of the first cassette tapes I had ever bought. &amp;ldquo;Insane in the Membrane&amp;rdquo; was the lead single which ended up becoming a hit nationwide. I&amp;rsquo;d say it is still one of the defining Hip-Hop tracks of the 90&amp;rsquo;s among the likes of &amp;ldquo;Baby Got Back&amp;rdquo; by Sir-Mix-A-Lot and &amp;ldquo;Jump Around&amp;rdquo; by House of Pain. &amp;ldquo;I Ain&amp;rsquo;t Going Out Like That&amp;rdquo; was a hard-hitting follow-up track along the lines of &amp;ldquo;Deep Cover.&amp;rdquo; With two strong lead singles Black Sunday definitely made Cypress Hill known on the East Coast but their several subsequent albums never had the same appeal or radio attention. Honestly, I can&amp;rsquo;t say that I have heard Cypress Hill on East Coast radio since Black Sunday. The tracks that I like which came afterwards are ones that I saw music videos for: &amp;ldquo;Tequila Sunrise&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Rap Superstar.&amp;rdquo; Maybe in this era of streaming music I should take the time to catch up on their discography. I&amp;rsquo;ll put that on my to-do list for next week.&lt;/p&gt;
