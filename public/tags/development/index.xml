      <description>&lt;p&gt;Throwback Thursday: Crucial Conflict: Hay / Scummy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Back in 1996 I remember seeing a promo video (commercial) on &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/fEs8LanCuKw?list=RDSCf4203RnLM&#34;&gt;The Box&lt;/a&gt;, a now defunct music video channel, for a group called Crucial Conflict. To paraphrase the tagline, &amp;ldquo;The sun rises in the east and sets in the west but its highest point is in the middle.&amp;rdquo; Those words were voiced over video footage of a horse-drawn carriage riding through the hood. Soon, I saw the video for &amp;ldquo;Hay&amp;rdquo; with the country-western-inspired imagery of barnyards, cowboys, leather and denim overalls offset by the urban imagery of Black men with braided hair rapping about &amp;ldquo;smoking on hay in the middle of the barn.&amp;rdquo; The description may seem ridiculous, especially by today&amp;rsquo;s standards of what good rap music is, but they pulled it off well.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Crucial Conflict emerged from Chicago at a time when the R&amp;amp;B infused raps about street life were winding down and the violent, gang-related lyrics of drill music had yet to come. They had a good mix of solid lyricism and unique style with their &amp;ldquo;rodeo rap.&amp;rdquo; Instead of following the quick-tongue style that was popularized in their region they were similar to Three Six Mafia in delivery and Lil&amp;rsquo; Jon&amp;rsquo;s crunk music for the party factor. I remember their debut album &amp;ldquo;The Final Tic&amp;rdquo; selling Gold at some point and when I started high school later that year &amp;ldquo;Hay&amp;rdquo; was playing in portable stereos once class let out for the day.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
They had fallen off of my radar for a couple of years until I saw a video for &amp;ldquo;Scummy,&amp;rdquo; the lead single from a follow-up album titled &amp;ldquo;Good Side Bad Side&amp;rdquo;. True to their original form they were back with the hard-hitting rodeo rap that made you subconsciously nod your head. I heard them featured on a song with R. Kelly but aside from that they never made it big, which is sad because I consider them to be the most innovative rap outfit from Chicago in the 90&amp;rsquo;s. I recently revisited their music on Spotify and was enthused to see a Crucial Conflict release from this year only to find out that it was a heavy metal group using the name. Maybe the group has long since called it quits but for at least a brief period of time they made their mark on rap music.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>If You Use Vagrant Then You Should Give Otto a Try</title>
      <link>http://blog.nocdib.com/If-you-use-Vagrant-then-you-should-be-using-Otto/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 25 Apr 2016 06:13:52 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.nocdib.com/If-you-use-Vagrant-then-you-should-be-using-Otto/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was first introduced to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vagrantup.com/&#34;&gt;Vagrant&lt;/a&gt; while working on a backend development project last year. If you aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar with Vagrant it&amp;rsquo;s basically a configuration wrapper around your preferred virtual machine software that permits you to customize the setup of a VM using a text file called Vagrantfile along with any desired  provisioning files (Chef, Salt, Ansible). Since the configuration is managed with text files it&amp;rsquo;s easy to make changes without manually removing and installing software on the VM and the settings are easily shareable among different users using version control. The alternatives would be to either manually configure a VM and distribute the large image file or to develop the application on individual workstations. With the latter you are bound to encounter the issue of inconsistent behavior due to variances in machine setups among the team. Vagrant is  mature and has been widely adopted by the tech industry, so much so that it spawned &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hashicorp.com&#34;&gt;a company&lt;/a&gt; that focuses on open source and commercial dev ops software offerings. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure whether it was deliberate or consequential but each of the products after Vagrant were interoperable and formed a suite of distributed systems management solutions. In a clever and resourceful move, Hashicorp combined the VM management of Vagrant with some of their other offerings into a single solution that not only allows you to develop your standalone applications but also to deploy them to the cloud without ever needing to leave your command-line. This all-in-one solution is called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/otto.html&#34;&gt;Otto.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otto&amp;rsquo;s level of automation is steps beyond what even Vagrant does to the point where it can detect the file types of an existing project and automatically configure a development environment for it. For example, run the &amp;ldquo;otto compile&amp;rdquo; command in a folder with Golang .go source files and you get an environment that already has a Gopath configured to the directory  the command was run from. For building workstation environments Otto leverages Vagrant under the hood. If you only need it for local development then you can use it for just that. Want to deploy your project to Amazon Web Services? Otto will automatically download &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.packer.io/&#34;&gt;Packer&lt;/a&gt; to build your desired image and then use &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.terraform.io&#34;&gt;Terraform&lt;/a&gt; to deploy it without you having to touch the AWS console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otto is in the early zero-point version stages so it&amp;rsquo;s probably a good idea to give it some more time before implementing it in a mission-critical production setting. If you are on a small team that can afford to audit new technology then Otto is well worth it. For my personal project use it&amp;rsquo;s more than sufficient so I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to stick with it instead of standalone Vagrant because it&amp;rsquo;s bound to be the full successor by the time it&amp;rsquo;s production certified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/b&gt; This is an honest and unbiased assessment. I am in no way affiliated with Hashicorp or its employees. I did meet &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/mitchellh&#34;&gt;Mitchell Hashimoto&lt;/a&gt; once, though.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Best Golang Tutorial Around</title>
      <link>http://blog.nocdib.com/The-best-golang-tutorial-around/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 25 Mar 2016 13:21:51 -0400</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;TL;DR: Read &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.golangbootcamp.com/book&#34; target=&#34;_new&#34;&gt;this tutorial&lt;/a&gt; and watch &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.udemy.com/learn-how-to-code/learn/v4/content&#34; target=&#34;_new&#34;&gt;these videos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Golang, also known as Go, has been gaining traction in recent years as a mainstream programming language, particularly in the space of web services. At a time when dynamically-typed, interpreted languages like Python and Ruby are dominating that arena while the frameworks that are built with them are handling front-end content or REST API calls I found it interesting that a statically-typed, compiled language had a growing buzz around it. Back in Spring 2012, after I had just ended a job that made heavy use of Erlang I remember my cousin&amp;rsquo;s husband mentioning his interest in learning Go. Having just dealt with a niche language like Erlang&amp;ndash;which I found to be unpleasant&amp;ndash;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t interested in even hearing about another programming language that hadn&amp;rsquo;t been widely adopted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the middle of 2014 &lt;a href=&#34;http://nickmanning.net/&#34; target=&#34;_new&#34;&gt;Nick Manning&lt;/a&gt; started the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/nycgolang/&#34; target=&#34;_new&#34;&gt;Golang NYC meetup group&lt;/a&gt; and I began attending since I already knew him from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/nycneo4j/&#34; target=&#34;_new&#34;&gt;NYC Neo4j meetup group&lt;/a&gt;. Hearing the testimonials of Go converts piqued my interest but one meeting in particular made me want to try the language for myself. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bjornroche.com/&#34; target=&#34;_new&#34;&gt;Bjorn Roche&lt;/a&gt; gave a presentation about using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://revel.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_new&#34;&gt;Revel web framework&lt;/a&gt; to power the backend of the mobile app &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.shimmeo.com/&#34; target=&#34;_new&#34;&gt;Shimmeo&lt;/a&gt;. During the presentation he compared Revel to the Java/Scala web framework &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.playframework.com&#34; target=&#34;_new&#34;&gt;Play&lt;/a&gt;. I had a strong interest in Play and was about to use it on my own personal project but after hearing that there was a Go equivalent I was convinced to give Go and Revel a try. Nothing helps you learn a new language better than actually implementing something with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first step was to learn Go. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty particular with my learning materials and I&amp;rsquo;m just not the type who becomes proficient from online documentation and web searches alone. Finding the right introductory material wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy since there was a dearth of tutorials and well-written, published books on Go. I had found one e-book, whose name I will not mention, but I found its explanation and the progression of material to be deficient. By chance I had stumbled upon one of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/user/toddmcleod&#34; target=&#34;_new&#34;&gt;Todd Mcleod&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; YouTube videos and left a comment. He quickly responded and suggested that I take a look at a new Golang video course that he recently published on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.udemy.com/learn-how-to-code/learn/v4/content&#34; target=&#34;_new&#34;&gt;Udemy&lt;/a&gt;. I bought access to the videos for a nominal fee and it was the best investment in programming-related material that I have ever made. Simply put, if you have prior computer programming experience there is no way that you couldn&amp;rsquo;t become proficient with Go by the end of the course. While doing the course I had also come across Matt Aimonetti&amp;rsquo;s e-book &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.golangbootcamp.com/book&#34; target=&#34;_new&#34;&gt;Go Bootcamp&lt;/a&gt; and noticed that Todd McLeod&amp;rsquo;s course actually elaborated on many of those examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in learning Go and are looking for a tutorial that blends brevity with comprehensiveness then I suggest reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.golangbootcamp.com/book&#34; target=&#34;_new&#34;&gt;Go Bootcamp&lt;/a&gt;. If you need greater depth then look at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.udemy.com/learn-how-to-code/learn/v4/content&#34; target=&#34;_new&#34;&gt;Todd&amp;rsquo;s video course on Udemy&lt;/a&gt;. After tackling the language with these resources I actually found it better to create my own REST API without using a framework. Go is a powerful language that allows you to do just that without a lot of overhead.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Journey Of A Thousand Miles Begins With A Leap</title>
      <link>http://blog.nocdib.com/A-journey-of-a-thousand-miles-begins-with-a-leap/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been a long time coming (about 6 years) but I’ve finally settled on an idea for a mobile development project to invest my time into. Two years of that time was spent selecting an idea that wasn’t already at least partially implemented, another two years was spent getting acclimated with the tech scene well enough to know which direction to go with it and another two years was was spent dealing with life in general along with general laziness. I&amp;rsquo;ve been gainfully employed for the entire time so it&amp;rsquo;s not as though this project was something that I thought about daily. Now is just the time that I decided to double-down and actually get serious about building something tangible. I have high hopes for my idea so I figured that I will chronicle my progress. If nobody ever reads this it will still be my personal record of the steps I made towards accomplishing something that I&amp;rsquo;ve been dreaming about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All posts related to this project will be prefaced with &amp;ldquo;YB.&amp;rdquo; I don&amp;rsquo;t want to mention specifics about what the app will do but I will say that it is mobile-first, socially-based and has heavy emphasis on geolocation. I will be developing the full stack on my own using technologies that I am learning along the way. Hopefully this will become the resource that I wish I found back in the Summer of 2009 to help me get started. If I could minimize the time needed for someone to undertake their own project then I’d be more than satisfied. While I don’t believe in numerology, astrology or any other form of time/numeric-based omens I can’t help but think that today being &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year#Leap_day&#34;&gt;Leap Day&lt;/a&gt; is psuedo-symbolic since I’m going forward to embark on this personal quest. Well, here goes nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
