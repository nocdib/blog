			 	<h1>The Best Golang Tutorial Around</h1>
			  <span class="post-date">Fri, Mar 25, 2016</span>
			      <p><i>TL;DR: Read <a href="http://www.golangbootcamp.com/book" target="_new">this tutorial</a> and watch <a href="https://www.udemy.com/learn-how-to-code/learn/v4/content" target="_new">these videos</a>.</i></p>

<p>Golang, also known as Go, has been gaining traction in recent years as a mainstream programming language, particularly in the space of web services. At a time when dynamically-typed, interpreted languages like Python and Ruby are dominating that arena while the frameworks that are built with them are handling front-end content or REST API calls I found it interesting that a statically-typed, compiled language had a growing buzz around it. Back in Spring 2012, after I had just ended a job that made heavy use of Erlang I remember my cousin&rsquo;s husband mentioning his interest in learning Go. Having just dealt with a niche language like Erlang&ndash;which I found to be unpleasant&ndash;I wasn&rsquo;t interested in even hearing about another programming language that hadn&rsquo;t been widely adopted.</p>

<p>In the middle of 2014 <a href="http://nickmanning.net/" target="_new">Nick Manning</a> started the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/nycgolang/" target="_new">Golang NYC meetup group</a> and I began attending since I already knew him from the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/nycneo4j/" target="_new">NYC Neo4j meetup group</a>. Hearing the testimonials of Go converts piqued my interest but one meeting in particular made me want to try the language for myself. <a href="http://www.bjornroche.com/" target="_new">Bjorn Roche</a> gave a presentation about using the <a href="https://revel.github.io/" target="_new">Revel web framework</a> to power the backend of the mobile app <a href="https://www.shimmeo.com/" target="_new">Shimmeo</a>. During the presentation he compared Revel to the Java/Scala web framework <a href="http://www.playframework.com" target="_new">Play</a>. I had a strong interest in Play and was about to use it on my own personal project but after hearing that there was a Go equivalent I was convinced to give Go and Revel a try. Nothing helps you learn a new language better than actually implementing something with it.</p>

<p>My first step was to learn Go. I&rsquo;m pretty particular with my learning materials and I&rsquo;m just not the type who becomes proficient from online documentation and web searches alone. Finding the right introductory material wasn&rsquo;t easy since there was a dearth of tutorials and well-written, published books on Go. I had found one e-book, whose name I will not mention, but I found its explanation and the progression of material to be deficient. By chance I had stumbled upon one of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/toddmcleod" target="_new">Todd Mcleod&rsquo;s</a> YouTube videos and left a comment. He quickly responded and suggested that I take a look at a new Golang video course that he recently published on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/learn-how-to-code/learn/v4/content" target="_new">Udemy</a>. I bought access to the videos for a nominal fee and it was the best investment in programming-related material that I have ever made. Simply put, if you have prior computer programming experience there is no way that you couldn&rsquo;t become proficient with Go by the end of the course. While doing the course I had also come across Matt Aimonetti&rsquo;s e-book <a href="http://www.golangbootcamp.com/book" target="_new">Go Bootcamp</a> and noticed that Todd McLeod&rsquo;s course actually elaborated on many of those examples.</p>

<p>If you are interested in learning Go and are looking for a tutorial that blends brevity with comprehensiveness then I suggest reading <a href="http://www.golangbootcamp.com/book" target="_new">Go Bootcamp</a>. If you need greater depth then look at <a href="https://www.udemy.com/learn-how-to-code/learn/v4/content" target="_new">Todd&rsquo;s video course on Udemy</a>. After tackling the language with these resources I actually found it better to create my own REST API without using a framework. Go is a powerful language that allows you to do just that without a lot of overhead.</p>
