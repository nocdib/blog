      <description>&lt;p&gt;Throwback Thursday: Crucial Conflict: Hay / Scummy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Fg2NRCB9Sc&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/xArkAYPkkp8&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Back in 1996 I remember seeing a promo video (commercial) on &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/fEs8LanCuKw?list=RDSCf4203RnLM&#34;&gt;The Box&lt;/a&gt;, a now defunct music video channel, for a group called Crucial Conflict. To paraphrase the tagline, &amp;ldquo;The sun rises in the east and sets in the west but its highest point is in the middle.&amp;rdquo; Those words were voiced over video footage of a horse-drawn carriage riding through the hood. Soon, I saw the video for &amp;ldquo;Hay&amp;rdquo; with the country-western-inspired imagery of barnyards, cowboys, leather and denim overalls offset by the urban imagery of Black men with braided hair rapping about &amp;ldquo;smoking on hay in the middle of the barn.&amp;rdquo; The description may seem ridiculous, especially by today&amp;rsquo;s standards of what good rap music is, but they pulled it off well.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Crucial Conflict emerged from Chicago at a time when the R&amp;amp;B infused raps about street life were winding down and the violent, gang-related lyrics of drill music had yet to come. They had a good mix of solid lyricism and unique style with their &amp;ldquo;rodeo rap.&amp;rdquo; Instead of following the quick-tongue style that was popularized in their region they were similar to Three Six Mafia in delivery and Lil&amp;rsquo; Jon&amp;rsquo;s crunk music for the party factor. I remember their debut album &amp;ldquo;The Final Tic&amp;rdquo; selling Gold at some point and when I started high school later that year &amp;ldquo;Hay&amp;rdquo; was playing in portable stereos once class let out for the day.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
They had fallen off of my radar for a couple of years until I saw a video for &amp;ldquo;Scummy,&amp;rdquo; the lead single from a follow-up album titled &amp;ldquo;Good Side Bad Side&amp;rdquo;. True to their original form they were back with the hard-hitting rodeo rap that made you subconsciously nod your head. I heard them featured on a song with R. Kelly but aside from that they never made it big, which is sad because I consider them to be the most innovative rap outfit from Chicago in the 90&amp;rsquo;s. I recently revisited their music on Spotify and was enthused to see a Crucial Conflict release from this year only to find out that it was a heavy metal group using the name. Maybe the group has long since called it quits but for at least a brief period of time they made their mark on rap music.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Throwback Thursday: Cypress Hill - Insane in the Membrane</title>

&lt;br/&gt;
In observance of Cinco de Mayo (Mexican Independence Day) I&amp;rsquo;ll walk down memory lane with the Cypress Hill. Truth be told B-Real is half-Mexican, Sen Dog is Cuban and DJ Muggs is Italian-American but still. The &amp;ldquo;Black Sunday&amp;rdquo; album was one of the first cassette tapes I had ever bought. &amp;ldquo;Insane in the Membrane&amp;rdquo; was the lead single which ended up becoming a hit nationwide. I&amp;rsquo;d say it is still one of the defining Hip-Hop tracks of the 90&amp;rsquo;s among the likes of &amp;ldquo;Baby Got Back&amp;rdquo; by Sir-Mix-A-Lot and &amp;ldquo;Jump Around&amp;rdquo; by House of Pain. &amp;ldquo;I Ain&amp;rsquo;t Going Out Like That&amp;rdquo; was a hard-hitting follow-up track along the lines of &amp;ldquo;Deep Cover.&amp;rdquo; With two strong lead singles Black Sunday definitely made Cypress Hill known on the East Coast but their several subsequent albums never had the same appeal or radio attention. Honestly, I can&amp;rsquo;t say that I have heard Cypress Hill on East Coast radio since Black Sunday. The tracks that I like which came afterwards are ones that I saw music videos for: &amp;ldquo;Tequila Sunrise&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Rap Superstar.&amp;rdquo; Maybe in this era of streaming music I should take the time to catch up on their discography. I&amp;rsquo;ll put that on my to-do list for next week.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Throwback Thursday: Eric B and Rakim - I Aint No Joke</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/2TN-kDEKxF0&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
If you ask a group of true hip-hop fans who the top 5 greatest lyricists of all time are you&amp;rsquo;d likely hear the name Rakim mentioned at least 70% of the time. Your favorite rapper (over the age of 30) probably has him in the top 3. His whole persona embodied the essence of what I remembered 80&amp;rsquo;s New York City hip-hop being but I didn&amp;rsquo;t catch onto him until his first solo album was released in 1997. Prior to that he was part of the eponymous DJ/MC duo Eric B and Rakim but their career spanned from 1987 to 1992, or from when I was between ages 5 and 10. As a kid, the only people around my age who knew of their music learned of them through an older sibling so I didn&amp;rsquo;t acknowledge them until I had gotten much older.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I can&amp;rsquo;t recall when exactly was the first time I had heard &amp;ldquo;I Ain&amp;rsquo;t No Joke&amp;rdquo; but I know it was the bass drum and clap pattern that caught me first and then Rakim&amp;rsquo;s braggadocious lyrics. The music video also captured the zeitgeist of NYC at the time with the flat-top haircuts, Fila windbreakers, gold rope chains, rings on all fingers, graffiti murals, etc. If I had to pick one definitive track for hip-hop in the late 80&amp;rsquo;s it would be this one for it&amp;rsquo;s versatility as a party-rocker, a lyrical showcase and a DJ showcase. It&amp;rsquo;s crazy how it&amp;rsquo;s almost 30 years old.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Throwback Thursday: A Tribe Called - Quest Award Tour</title>
      <link>http://blog.nocdib.com/Throwback-Thursday-A-Tribe-Called-Quest-Award-Tour/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/P800UWoE9xs&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1993 was an interesting year for me musically because I was 11 and it had been about a year since I started taking a personal interest in music. At the end of the prior year Dr. Dre released his classic album The Chronic. Mid-1993 saw Tupac emerge as a bonafide solo artist with &amp;ldquo;I Get A Round&amp;rdquo; and Cypress Hill dropped their classic &amp;ldquo;Insane in the Membrane&amp;rdquo; around the same time. Growing up in New Jersey and gravitating towards West Coast rap while being completely oblivious to the East Coast fixtures seems odd in retrospect but at the time I knew nothing about anything else. November of 1993 had another West Coast classic, Snoop Doggy Dogg&amp;rsquo;s Doggystyle, take the music world by storm but earlier that month A Tribe Called Quest released Midnight Marauders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day that Midnight Marauders was released, November 9, 1993, was also the day that the Wu Tang Clan released their debut album which captivated me and took the NYC area radio stations by storm. Still, A Tribe Called Quest&amp;rsquo;s lead single &amp;ldquo;Award Tour&amp;rdquo; managed to get some consistent radio play and it was my introduction to the group. The follow-up single &amp;ldquo;Electric Relaxation&amp;rdquo; was sonically pleasing but my hip-hop tastes were in another direction and A Tribe Called Quest became a musical afterthought to me. I recognized their merit but I was never truly a fan. Me being from the East Coast and admitting this is blasphemy to some people but it&amp;rsquo;s the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only recently have I gained an interest in listening to earlier music from A Tribe Called Quest and fellow Native Tongues members Leaders of the New School and De La Soul. Sadly, yesterday, I heard that group member Phife Dawg had passed away. I had known for years that he had kidney issues and I&amp;rsquo;m sorry to hear that he succumbed to his ailment. While being soberly reminded about the frailty of our mortal existence I&amp;rsquo;ll use this news as motivation to listen to their entire discography in chronological order. Maybe my more mature listening ear will finally be able to recognize what so many hip-hop fans have already recognized decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R.I.P Malik &amp;ldquo;Phife Dawg&amp;rdquo; Taylor&lt;br/&gt;
November 20, 1970 – March 22, 2016&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Throwback Thursday: Lin Que - Let it Fall</title>
      <link>http://blog.nocdib.com/Throwback-Thursday-Lin-Que-Let-it-fall/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks to YouTube&amp;rsquo;s autoplay feature this mid-90&amp;rsquo;s gem started playing. In a day where Nicki Minaj is the queen of NYC rap it&amp;rsquo;s nice to take a trip down memory lane to 21 years ago when female emcees were as gritty as the guys. Lin Que was cut from the same cloth as Champ MC, Boss, Nonchalant and Fugees-era Lauryn Hill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, Hype Williams co-directed the video and he is the father of the 90&amp;rsquo;s Hip Hop music video directors. This video shows his signature use of fades between shots but while he&amp;rsquo;s known for his use of vivid color he went for black-an-white this time. Under Sylvia Rhone&amp;rsquo;s guidance Elektra Records was responsible for a number of female acts in 90&amp;rsquo;s urban music. Lin Que wasn&amp;rsquo;t as commercially successful as labelmates like Missy Elliot but she defnitely represented lyrically.&lt;/p&gt;
